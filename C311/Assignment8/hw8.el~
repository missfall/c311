; Looking at the information, the count from the first revision of the combination code has much more
; recursive calls compared to the dynamic programming made combination code. The dynamic recursive count
; seems to always be less than or equal to the n in the function call. The first revision recursive count
; seems to always be greater than the n in the function call. This holds true for the three tests I have
; conducted. If some math has been used and stored in the array for dynamic programming it is a recursive
; count of 1. This is because it uses the "look up" array to find the value without having to do the math
; invovled with it. Therefore, the more calls for the dynamic version of the combinitorial code, the more
; efficient it will be when calculating very large numbers.
